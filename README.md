# CaliforniaHousing
In this mini project we model the house price of different districts in California. This work includes: 1. Data cleaning and preparation, 2. Exploratary data analyis, 3. Machine learning and 4. Model tuning and optimization. 
Here we used sklearn package for machine learning. We applied Linear Regression, Descision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression algorithms.
# Data Source
This dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from Luís Torgo's page (University of Porto). Luís Torgo obtained it from the StatLib repository (which is closed now). The dataset may also be downloaded from StatLib mirrors.

This dataset appeared in a 1997 paper titled Sparse Spatial Autoregressions by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry, published in the Statistics and Probability Letters journal. They built it using the 1990 California census data. It contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).
